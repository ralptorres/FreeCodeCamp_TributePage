            José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (Spanish: [xoˈse
            riˈsal, -ˈθal], Tagalog: [hoˈse ɾiˈsal]; June 19, 1861 – December
            30, 1896) was a Filipino nationalist, writer and polymath active at
            the end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. He is
            considered a national hero (pambansang bayani) of the Philippines.
            An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key
            member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, which advocated
            political reforms for the colony under Spain. He was executed by the
            Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the
            Philippine Revolution broke out; it was inspired by his writings.
            Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he
            ultimately approved of its goals which eventually resulted in
            Philippine independence. Rizal is widely considered one of the
            greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to be so
            honored by an officially empaneled National Heroes Committee.
            However, no law, executive order or proclamation has been enacted or
            issued officially proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a
            national hero. He wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (1887) and El
            filibusterismo (1891), which together are taken as a national epic,
            in addition to numerous poems and essays.
